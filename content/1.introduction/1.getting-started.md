# Getting Started
Getting started with setting up these tools takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get it down It's easy

If you are looking to just use the tools, there will be a brief summary under the setup section, however this site is mostly for self hosting!

::alert{type="info"}
âœ¨ Now I really should have made an org to organize these projects, but most will be linked @ [the main repo](https://github.com/dswan36/SillyLittleFiles)
::

We mainly work with GitHub repositories since:
::list{type="success"}
- It's free!
- It's open source :D
- And you get free stuff through [Github Education](https://education.github.com) while being a student!
::
Due however note:
::list{type="warning"}
- Github is intended to be used by people who know what they are doing (might be a learning curve)
- Most developer tools will take some critical thinking and willpower
::
::list{type="danger"}
- It might get a little complex
::
::list{type="info"}
- I believe in you!
- That's why these docs exist.
- I can't host my own stuff forever for free XP
