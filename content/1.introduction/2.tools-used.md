# Tools We'll be using
For these projects there are two main tools (excluding :icon{name="logos:github-icon"}Github) used
## Firebase! :icon{name="logos:google-cloud-platform"}
1. Because it's free with a Google Account (and some accounts still let you access it)
2. Because it's easy to set up static web hosting, (why it's used on [SLF](https://github.com/dswan36/SillyLittleFiles)).

It does however have an annoying setup on :icon{name="logos:github-icon"}Gihub IMHO, because you have to make a .yaml action and setup some funkey :icon{name="logos:google-cloud-platform"}Google Cloud IAMs. 
But any static web hoster should be able to host [SLF](https://github.com/dswan36/SillyLittleFiles) Fine.

::list{type="success"}
- To use It you just need a :icon{name="logos:google-icon"}Google Account
- .web.app servers (Which will most likely never be blocked by an org)
- Custom domain setup is pretty easy as far as it goes
- You can delete unused builds
::
Due however note:
::list{type="warning"}
- Very DIY tool in some regards.
- Manual Setup in codespaces
- Requires manually setting up Github Actions for deploys.
- Requires interacting with Google Cloud Service Accounts to setup Github Actions
- :icon{name="logos:google-icon"}Google will ratelimit too many builds in a short period of time
- Builds automatically expire (can be good or bad)
- :icon{name="logos:google-cloud-platform"}Firebase has a lot of other features that can let you get lost
::
::list{type="danger"}
- It is usually disabled on :icon{name="logos:google-icon"}Google Accounts under 18
::
::list{type="info"}
- If you can't host it using a managed :icon{name="logos:google-icon"}Google account, possibly host it from home, or on your own account.

## Vercel :icon{name="logos:vercel-icon"}

Oh how I love :icon{name="logos:vercel-icon"}Vercel.
A free Static and Semi-dynamic hosting platform that can get some basic sites (with some more complex tools) running. 
It's how [SLA](https://github.com/dswan36/acprox) Works!

::list{type="success"}
- Free with no butts
- You can use a :icon{name="logos:github-icon"}Github account to login
- You can use various other accounts, or an individual account to login
- Can be seperate from your other accounts
- :icon{name="logos:vercel-icon"}Vercel is just for hosting, so there isnt anything to get lost in
- One Click Deploys!!!
::
Due however note:
::list{type="warning"}
- :icon{name="logos:vercel-icon"}Vercel ratelimits you if you build too many production builds (commits to main branch), I don't think you can delete builds.
- Builds don't expire (can be good or bad)
::
::list{type="danger"}
- .vercel.app domains could possibly be more commonly blocked
- Custom domain setup seems to sometimes like to fight with you
::
::list{type="info"}
- Can host all kinds of static website types.
- One click deploy with :icon{name="logos:github-icon"}Github
