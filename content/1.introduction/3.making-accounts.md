# Making Accounts Needed
::alert{type="warning}
:icon{name="flat-color-icons:answers"} | This page dosen't match the quality precedent of other pages, and is in need of cleanup
::

The first thing you would probally need is a :icon{name="logos:github-icon"}[Github](https://github.com) account, so you can store the code!

::alert{type="warning"}
ðŸ¤” Some account's will have Firebase disabled, usually account's marked as under 18 (but you never know, or you could use another account)
::

Other than that (if you can) make a :icon{name="logos:google-cloud-platform"}[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) project.

Also make an account @ :icon{name="logos:vercel-icon"}[Vercel](https://vercel.app) which you can make using your previously made :icon{name="logos:github-icon"}[Github](https://github.com) account.
