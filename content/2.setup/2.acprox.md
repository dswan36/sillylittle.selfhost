ℹ️ | This documentation is for setting up https://go.sillylittle.tech on your own domain/setup, visit the URL for the publically hosted version.\
The tool provides access to some pre-made shortcuts, and the ability to prox into websites. \
It's URLs are encoded to prevent snooping eyes!

It's easy to setup and can be done with less work and is easier to use than a full Private Network, but will have more overhead.

First Clone it with [this link](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/dswan36/acprox) to your Vercel account!

Vercel will help you make a new repo and deploy it..... and that should be it.

After that you can also setup any custom domains in Settings > Domains

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that some links may break in this app if you are not hosting on a custom domain (the links to the status page and main website on the homepage), as this guide expects you to. However, as is the nature with any open source project, you can simply edit it.
