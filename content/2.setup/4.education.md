::alert{type="info"}
::icon{name="flat-color-icons:info"} [Github Education](https://education.github.com/) may require you to verify via school ID, which may be a privacy violation to some.

::icon{name="logos:github-icon"} [Github Education](https://education.github.com/) is a program that is run by Github that allows students to get free benifits.

::icon{name="flat-color-icons:like"} The main benifits regarding this project are [Github Pro](https://github.com/pricing), which gives access to fun features like CodeSpaces.

And then. Some providers offer free domainnames! The best provider IMHO is [.tech](https://get.tech) because they allow you to renew it every time you renew your Github Education.

With this combination of tools you can superpower your access and allow free speech anywhere you are. (I trust you not to use for evil)

::alert{type="warning"}
::icon{name="flat-color-icons:expired"} Students! Make sure to renew your [Github Education](https://education.github.com/) each year to retain benifits. You can do this on [this page](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application)
