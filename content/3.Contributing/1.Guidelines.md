## Guidelines
There are not many guidelines to contributing to any of my projects, and that is 1. Because no one ever does and 2. Because most of the time things are self explained.
However if you want to contribute to the SLF project, PROX tools, or documentation, please remember the following.
- Follow OSS standard etiquittes, be kind, be respectful, and have good faith.
- No matter what, keep the spirit of the project alive.
- I will not and cannot host this project forever (see [dswan36/SillyLittleFiles#267](https://github.com/dswan36/SillyLittleFiles/discussions/267)). However be free to use my information and documentation in your own projects.
- If you want to contribute back, and down't know how, feel free to [ask](https://github.com/dswan36/SillyLittleFiles/discussions/categories/get-help).
- Feel free to make your own revitalization, or spin on my works. (I would like to be accredited tho if possible :D)
- More questions, need more info? Contact me at either ***questions@sillylittle \[dot] tech*** or ***kk5dire@pm \[dot] me***
